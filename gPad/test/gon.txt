Gon (ゴン?) is a tiny fictional dinosaur and the title character of a Japanese manga series created by Masashi Tanaka.
The Gon series features the completely wordless adventures of the irascible title character as he interacts with the natural world, depicted by Tanaka in lush, realistic detail. 
Gon somehow survived the extinction of his fellow dinosaurs and interacts with paleolithic animals. 
Gon was most notable outside of Japan for his appearance in the Tekken 3 video game. 
An animated TV series began airing in Japan on April 2, 2012.
